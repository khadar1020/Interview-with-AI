## Why Prepwise?

Preparing for interviews can be stressful — especially when you're not sure how you'll perform under pressure. Most people don’t have someone available 24/7 to do mock interviews or provide detailed feedback.

Prepwise solves this by giving you:
- A realistic, voice-based interview simulation
- Smart, AI-generated questions
- Real-time tips to improve your answers

Whether you're prepping for your first interview or your tenth, Prepwise makes it easy to get better.
